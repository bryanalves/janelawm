# JanelaWM

This is a very early version of a ruby-based window manager.  There is no tiling support yet, but it's goal is to become a dynamic tiling manager similar to XMonad, DWM, or Awesome.

# Why Build this?

This is an excuse to make a reasonable XCB library for ruby, and there is room in the WM ecosystem for a manager that has the flexibility and configurability of XMonad, but in an easier, more traditional interface.

# TODO

* Extract XCB FFI interface to a separate gem
* EWMH interface
* Package so it's actually runnable
* Layout support
